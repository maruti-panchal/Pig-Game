Welcome to the Pig Game, a simple and fun dice game for two players.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided die.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score resets to 0, and it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to "Hold," adding their current score to their total score.
- The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game.
